# Abstract {.unnumbered}

Should be around: 400 words.

Alfy says that you should write this first so that it limits your scope on the first pass...

Write a really good, simple dissertation, then expand on it with interesting stuff...

What is my hypothesis and research question?

---

Targeted annual rates of afforestation in the UK are rapidly increasing, the justification for which is often attributed to carbon sequestration for use as emissions offsets in achieving "Net Zero" ambitions.

In response to recent agricultural land purchases expressly for purposes of afforestation, this dissertation sets out to assess the current state of UK carbon markets, to determine the price at which it becomes more profitable to plant trees than food on any given piece of agricultural land by selling carbon credits, and to make policy recommendations based on these findings.

Though regulation of the creation of carbon units through existing certification schemes such as the Woodland Carbon Code seem robust, it is less clear that sufficient regulation governs the nascent market for trading carbon units produced under these schemes (a unit being equal to 1 tonne of $CO_2$  sequestered). Trading of units currently appears to occur under conditions of imperfect competition: sale prices are not tracked by any official body and can be subject to non-disclosure agreements, are reported to be increasing rapidly at a monthly time interval, and appear to be strongly influenced by imperfect information, expected co-benefits of the project (biodiversity, social value, etc.), and unit location. These conditions have created a highly speculative market, with rumoured sale prices for *ex-ante* units under the Woodland Carbon Code ranging from £2 to £80 per unit, though more confidence is placed in values between £15 and £25.

Intro quote:

"A huge amount of guff is talked about carbon offsetting" Dieter Helm, Professor of Energy Policy at the University of Oxford [@scottishlandandestatesScottishLandEstates2021].


Someone said on Farming Today that it is already more profitable to farm carbon that food in the uplands of the UK. This dissertation sets out to test that claim.

It has been 30 years since the first IPCC report was published, and for 30 years emissions have continued to rise. Today, emissions are 60% higher than they were when the IPCC published their first report [@ritchieGlobalCO2Emissions2020], and emissions must fall 50% by 2030 if we are to stay on track for a world of 1.5 degrees of warming (source). Stoddard et al., representing a global consortium of academics, find that one of the key drivers behind "our collective failure to bend the global emissions curve" is "is the central role of power and influential vested interests" [@stoddardThreeDecadesClimate2021]. With accusations that the influence of the fossil fuel induetry watered down the findings of the latest IPCC report [@westerveltIPCCWeCan2022], this influence seems to persist to this day.

"Two decades of all-but-futile climate negotiations have shown that global warming cannot be managed by means of technocratic expertise" [@mcafeeGreenEconomyCarbon2016]

People have jumped at the oppertunity to achieve net zero, rather than eliminate emissions...

How to link these? Need to talk about the need to reduce emissions, not just net zero.

"Reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 – and thus limiting the rise in global temperatures to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels – implies profound economic and societal shifts. According to a new report" [@krishnanAnatomyNetZeroTransition2022]

Achieving "Net Zero", commonly used to mean a balancing of anthropogenic carbon emissions and removals over a set period [@ipccAnnexGlossaryGlobal2018] though lacking an internationally agreed definition [@carbontrustNetZero2022; @climatepartnerWhatDoesNet2020], is increasingly cited as an aspirational target to be met by 2050. At least 100 national governments [@vansoestNetzeroEmissionTargets2021], including the UK [@dbeisNetZeroStrategy2021]; 826 cities and 1,565 companies [@nciandddelNavigatingNuancesNetzero2020], including 60 of the 100 largest companies in the UK [@edie60BritainLargest2021]; industry bodies [@nfuAchievingNETZERO2020]; and even a University of Edinburgh lecturer [@westonCarbonMyThing2021a] have either set or are considering the goal of Net Zero, and obtaining the right to emit carbon by paying others to reduce or remove it, otherwise known as carbon offsetting, is proposed to be one of the key pathways to achieving it (though 91% of countries, 79% of cities and 48% of companies fail to declare if offsets will be used in their Net Zero strategy or not [@haleCarbonOffsetMarket2022], 308 companies, 54 cities, and 28 countries have stated they will, based on data collected by Net Zero Tracker [-@netzerotrackerDownloadData2022]. Mark Carney's Taskforce for Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets has gone further, and is calling on organisations to commit not just to becomming 'Net Zero' by 2050, but to fully neutralize all emissions on the path to 'Net Zero' through carbon reductions and removals [-@taskforceforscalingvoluntarycarbonmarketsCallingHighAmbition2021]. Offsetting is particularly consequential for the agricultural sector, both due to the difficulty of eliminating many sources of carbon emissions in the necessary time frame (e.g., methane emissions from ruminant livestock), and because of the extent of land available to the sector for carbon removal. The CCC's Sector Summary for Agriculture and Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) from their Sixth Carbon Budget [@cccSectorSummaryAgriculture2020] states that in order to approach Net Zero in the UK by 2050, rates of afforestation must reach 30,000 ha/year by 2025 (a target the government has already committed to [@defraThousandsTreesBe2020], despite achieving just 29% of their 5,000 ha planting target in 2019 [@harveyTreeplantingEnglandFalls2019a], compared to Scotland achieving 89% of their 12,000 ha target (FM Handbook, p332)) and 50,000 ha/year by 2035. This includes the integration of trees on 10% of farmland by 2050, up from an estimated 1% in 2020 [@cccSectorSummaryAgriculture2020]. If this is achieved, combined emissions from the UK's LULUCF sector could fall to 16 MtCO2e by 2050, compared to 67.4 MtCO2e in 2018; this represents positive agricultural emissions of 35 MtCO2e and removal of 19 MtCO2e through nature-based sequestration.

How are positive agricultural emissions offset in the net zero strategy? Is the plan to revise those predictions?

The NFU's Achieving NET ZERO plan [-@nfuAchievingNETZERO2020] also calls for increased on-farm afforestation (among other commitments) if farming is to reach net zero. It estimates agricultural GHG savings of up to 9 MtCO2e/year through on-farm carbon sequestration alone. Both of these plans (CCC, 2020; NFU, 2020) assume that all emissions sequestered by the LULUCF sector will be counted against the sector's own irreducible emissions, as evidenced by neither document mentioning carbon trading. The UK Government, however, appears to be encouraging land owners (including farmers) to sell this captured carbon through voluntary carbon markets. For example, the Woodland Carbon Guarantee is designed to "accelerate woodland planting rates and develop the domestic market for woodland carbon by giving landowners the option to sell their captured carbon in the form of verified carbon credits" [@defraEnglandTreesAction2021] (voluntary carbon markets refer to carbon offsetting schemes, as opposed to 'mandatory' markets such as the UK's Emission Trading Scheme (ETS), the difference between these systems are detailed in Section X).


The BPS is being phased out and replaced by the ELMs payment system to farmers - the ELMs page below states that the government wants this income to come from both public and private sources, "Private sources of revenue include established markets for sustainable forestry or agriculture and eco-tourism, and growing markets for the sale of carbon or biodiversity credits." [@defraEnvironmentalLandManagement2022].

In December 2021, the price of carbon on the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) market is £73/tonne [@emberCarbonPricing2022]; the 'social cost of carbon' (SCCO2), an estimate of the damage done globally for every tonne of carbon emitted, has be proposed to exceed £2,200/tonne [@kikstraSocialCostCarbon2021a]. These two values represent the extremes of a scale at which carbon could be priced in the near future, at some point between which I propose there exists a price at which it will become more profitable to use agricultural land to plant trees and sell the associated carbon credits than it will be to produce food. UK broadleaf woodland captures around 7 tonnes of CO2/ha/year [@naturalenglandCarbonStorageSequestration2021], if carbon is priced even at the bottom end of this spectrum (£73/tonne), a farmer might expect to receive revenue of around £730/ha/year. The UK's Office for National Statistics (REPLACE WHOLE SENTENCE WITH TIFF DATA) reports that the average profit for wheat was £791/ha/year in 2019. Though this is comparing revenue to profit, the numbers are closer that one might expect, implying that the tipping point at which carbon-farming becomes more profitable than food-farming may not be very far away. A sudden spike in the price of carbon on a market like the UK ETS, (triggered, for example, by an extreme weather event) could cause the price to cross this threshold without us knowing we had crossed it. Individual farms might do the math themselves and see a new profitable venture in forestry, and if it takes more than a few weeks to control the market through legislation the sowing window for the abandoned crops might have already passed, with implications for the livelihoods of tenant farmers, national food security, and indirect land use change. For these reasons, I believe this research is both timely and important.

- Does the plan to protct 30% of land apply to the UK ? is it driving some of the afforestation / rewilding?
- Also there is the 30 by 30 goal
  + [@lurieProtecting30Earth2021]
  + More than 160 civil society organisations wrote an open letter on this topic...
    + [@forestpeoplesprogrammeCivilSocietyCalls2021]

---

I need to include my research questions

- Where is it most profitable to farm carbon UNDER CURRENT PRODUCTION CONDITIONS?
- Why are reports of land being sold primarily from Wales and Scotland?
- What production conditions could change to make carbon farming more/less costly?
  + Carbon Tax - Ruminant production and production on peatlands may suddenly become much less profitable - less profitable than hill farming?
    + Look at proposed carbon tax amounts and try to include in the calculations...?
  + Diet change
    + If a lot less meat is consumed, and therefore produced, how much land is freed up to plant trees without incurring any cost to land use change, tenant farmers, or food security?

---

I also need to mention investment firms buying land and land prices going up by 60% !! where is this? [@scottishlandcomissionMajorReportShows2022]

This would fit with that - Prices for prime Midwest ground climbed by up to a third in the past year as world food prices hit records - [@darbyshireInvestorsSeekingInflation2022]

Also this - Carbon capture pitches smallholders against big business - [@coxCarbonCapturePitches2022a]

"in the last 3 years we've noticed for those applications (to the glastier funding) for over 50 hectares of aforestation at a time, actually, 75% of them are coming from either companies, private investors, charities or individuals based outside of wales" - [@bbcradio4CostingEarthCarbon2022]

---

In Plato's Phaedrus, king Thamus laments to the god Theuth that by inventing writing, Theuth has allowed humans to become lazy:

"this discovery of yours will create forgetfulness in the learners’ souls, because they will not use their memories; they will trust to the external written characters and not remember of themselves."

[@mintoRankFile2021] (I should find an original source for this, not quote a quote)

We should be careful not to misuse the tools we are given; offsets can help us prevent >1.5 degrees of warming by 2100, but they will also do us harm if we misuse them.

# Literature Review {#Lit-Review}

There are two key reasons that it has not been possible to conduct a traditional systematic literature review for this project. First, the majority of publications on this topic fall within the classification of 'grey literature' and are not listed in academic databases; they primarily comprise of news articles and government, NGO, company, or charity reports. Secondly, in the words of Sir Dieter Helm, Professor of Energy Policy at the University of Oxford and author of well-respected books like "Net Zero" and "The Carbon Crunch" (is this the right book title?) (this would read better if I gave him another good sounding title, like he was on the UK Gov nature based solutions thing?), "a huge amount of guff is talked about carbon offsetting" [@scottishlandandestatesScottishLandEstates2021], which makes filtering out the cite-worthy sources something of a challenge.

Instead, Policy Commons, an indexed database of "uncatalogued, undiscoverable, uncitable, prone to link rot, and likely to disappear" sources, was used in a non systematic way to search relevant grey literature [@coherentdigitalOurMission2022], and perhaps too great a reliance was placed on the editorial teams of news outlets such as Project Syndicate, The Financial Times and The Guardian, and on the algorythmic search engine DuckDuckGo. All of these sources will have introduced bias to the selection of publications included, but it is isn't clear how else the search could have been conducted given the novelty, and guff-content, of publications in the field.

## A Brief History of International Carbon Markets
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

In 1992, 140 countries agreed to collectively begin an attempt to limit the imapct of anthropogenic GHG emissions on the climate and by 1997, had developed the Kyoto Protocol [@dechazournesIntroductoryNoteKyoto1997]. The Kyoto Protocol defined legally binding emissions targets for 39 industrialised countries (referred to as Annex I Parties) and allowed that these Parties could offset their emissions through (among other things) land based sequestration such as afforestation and reforestation projects; all other countries, though not legally required to reduce their own emissions, could engage in similar projects with the option of trading their emissions reductions internattionally as offsets under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) [@orlandoCarbonForestsPeople2002]. To expand the number of countries with emissions reductions targets and to overcome "often contentious negotiations" over legally binding targets, the 2015 Paris Agreement opted to adopt the 2009 Copenhagen Accord's bottom-up approach to climate policy and repalced the top-down, prescriptive emissions targets of the Kyoto Protocol with 'Nationally Determined Contributions' (NDCs), a country-specific collection of targets that are set and periodically refined by each country and that have received "virtually universal acceptance" [@bodanskyIntroductoryNoteParis2015]. Although the 2015 Paris Agreement laid out an intention to allow for the international trade of offsets, as was permitted under the Kyoto Protocol, the heterogeneaty of regionally specific NDCs meant that final agreement on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, a regulatory framework in part designed to avoide double counting (two or more parties claiming the same emissions offset) during trading, was not achieved until COP26 in 2021 [@oeko-institutCOP26GlasgowDelivered2021]. In their Sixth Assessment Report, Working Group III of the IPCC have stated that "the rapid deployment of [Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use sequestration] measures is essential in all pathways staying within the limits of the remaining budget for a 1.5◦C target" [@ipccClimateChange20222022], and the recent agreement of Article 6 suggests that such measures won't be limited to offsetting domestic emissions for much longer, in turn suggesting an expansion in the international market for carbon offsets (prviously, offsets could be sold internationally through private transactions, but could not be counted towards a country's NDCs).

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## What are Carbon Credits and Markets?
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

### Carbon Credits

Carbon credits, representing the avoidance, reduction or removal of one metric tonne of carbon dioxide, are traded through carbon markets. Both carbon credits and carbon markets come in multiple forms:

The Oxford Principles for Net Zero Aligned Carbon Offsetting [-@allenOxfordPrinciplesNet2020] outlines five types of carbon credit:

1. **Avoided Emissions**
    + e.g. Renewable energy
2. **Short-Lived Reduced Emissions**
    + e.g. Prevention of environmental degredation
3. **Long-Lived Reduced Emissions**
    + e.g. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) (of point-source emissions)
4. **Short-Lived Removed Emissions**
    + e.g. Afforestation
5. **Long-Lived Removed Emissions**
    + e.g. Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS) (of nonpoint-source emissions)

Where 'short-lived' refers to a time-period measured in decades and 'long-lived' refers to centuries or millennia.

### Carbon Markets

Carbon markets come in two main forms: voluntary and compliance markets.

Participants of a compliance market are legally required to limit their emissions and face punitive measures if they don't. Carbon taxes are a form of compliance market, as are 'cap and trade' systems, where a national government sets a maximum limit on sectoral emissions (the cap) and allocates tradable emissions permits to organisations within the sector. This allows high emitting players to trade permits with low emitting players (the trade), benefitting both but maintaining the emissions ceiling [@defraParticipatingUKETS2022]. Typically, the total permissable amount of emission falls each year, incentivising organisations to reduce emissions. The method of allocating permits within cap and trade systems is subject to some controversy [@helmNetZeroHow2021]. The UK and EU Emissions Trading Schemes (ETS) are examples of compliance markets, as is the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) established under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.

Currently, the UK ETS covers one third of national emissions and levys a fine of £100 per tonne for exceeding the allowance [@ngIntroducingUKEmissions2021]. Three sectors are covered by the UK ETS: power generation, heavy industry and aviation [@hmtreasuryNetZeroReview2021]. Compliance markets in New Zealand and South Korea include additional sectors, such as heating, transport, waste, and agriculture & forestry, covering 50% and 70% of emissions respectively [@hmtreasuryNetZeroReview2021]. The EU has proposed to expand their ETS scheme to cover around 85% of regional emissions [@hmtreasuryNetZeroReview2021].

Voluntary markets exist in addition to legally mandated emissions reductions. Actors within the voluntary market are incentivised by either moral or commercial objectives to purchase carbon credits and voluntarily offset emissions produced within their organisation or supply chain.

## Criticisms of Carbon Markets
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

GPT3

INPUT

Criticisms of carbon markets generally highlight specific faults in their implementation, rather than critiquing the idea of trading carbon directly. The design of carbon markets and the creation of carbon credits requires robust oversight,  without which 'junk credits' can undermine trust in legitimate ones ; @mccoskerWeNeverTouch2022];

This paper suggests that even a carbon tax may not always work:


"Although voluntary and offset markets have great potential, both have consistently failed to show that they lead to a net reduction in carbon emissions — what is known as additionality."
 [@mendelsohnHowRepairWorld2021]

There is a critique of credits generated through refuced emissions because it is hard to jedge what the baseline would have been had reduction not occured (the counterfactual)
[@helmValuingCarbonOffsets2021]

OUTPUT - Rewrite this!

A common critique of carbon markets is that they can be easily gamed and that there is little transparency or accountability in their operation.

Another critique is that carbon markets can create perverse incentives, such as allowing companies to profit from activities that increase emissions.

There is also concern that carbon markets may be used to offset emissions reductions that would have happened anyway, or that carbon credits may be generated for activities that have little or no impact on emissions.

Finally, some argue that carbon markets simply allow polluters to continue emitting greenhouse gases, while profiting from the sale of carbon credits.


<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

Criticisms of carbon markets generally highlight specific faults in the implementation of the market, rather than critiquing the idea directly. For example:

- A joint investigation by the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Australia Institute found that around 20% of carbon credits created under the federal scheme did not represent genuine abatement, meaning an estimated AUD 310 million had been spent on 26 million carbon credits that are not expected to remove any CO2 from the atmosphere [@mortonOneFiveCarbon2021].



Not sure how to do this section... really struggling with it... should it just be a list of criticisms? Should it be a single, well connected paragraph? Should I present the criticisms without comment, or should I say "all of these are criticisms of bad implementation, not reasons why good implementation would fail..."

### Excuse

- There is also an accusation that offsetting allows organisations to continue emitting, something that seems to be true of the NFU, who seem to think that they will be able to reach Net Zero without reducing production or ruminant livestock, in part by relying on on-farm sequestration to offset farm emissions

- There are many criticisms of carbon credits
  + [@sanoWhyRefuseCollude2021]

- "Over 200 groups have signed a letter to the members of Congress entitled “Oppose Carbon Offset Scams Like the Growing Climate Solutions Act”. The letter states: “These carbon offset schemes allow utilities, fossil fuel companies and other polluters to continue releasing greenhouse gases, instead of actually reducing and eliminating their emissions . . . The majority of the Earth’s carbon is stored in geological formations in the form of fossil fuels. Carbon locked in these ‘slow exchange’ reservoirs takes tens of thousands to millions of years to cycle back into the atmosphere — unless interrupted by volcanic eruptions or fossil fuel extraction and combustion. ‘Fast exchange’ reservoirs like soil and biomass have limited storage capacity and may re-release carbon in a matter of decades – or sooner from land conversion, unmitigated erosion due to flood episodes, or wildfires.”

- "Carbon leakage occurs when there is an increase in greenhouse gas emissions in one country as a result of an emissions reduction by a second country with a strict climate policy."
  + [@wikepediaCarbonLeakage2021]

-  Afforestation in the past has been a tax dodge...
  + That is indeed what happened in the tree-planting surge of the 1960s when companies such as Tilhill and Fountain Forestry planted huge areas of monoculture spruce as a tax dodge for landowners and high earners.

- "Many economists and policymakers hope that marginalism can be expanded to accommodate environmental issues, and that markets can become an instrument of sustainability. Hence, in the 1990s, the ecologist Gretchen Daily proposed that land be used as a marginal producer of “ecosystem services.” And in 1998, the economists Graciela Chichilnisky and Geoffrey Heal took this logic further, arguing that “privatizing natural capital and ecosystem services […] enlists self-interest and the profit motive in the cause of the environment.”"

- "Therefore, if land-based GHG removals like afforestation... were included in an ETS, the upper bound of what is desirable in terms of take-up... could be quickly reached, meaning that land-based solutions might not be available to offset emissions sources which are truly expensive and/or difficult to decarbonise in the long-run" CCC - page 12
  + [@cccAnnexFutureCarbon2019]

- “Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) is necessary to achieve net zero CO 2 and GHG emissions both globally and nationally, counterbalancing ‘hard-to-abate’ residual emissions.

    + [@scottishforestallianceCreatingWoodlandsWildlife2010]
  + It isn't clear if BP is selling units, but they've claimed them, so if not selling will likely use them to offset own emissions, which goes against their intention for planting the woods in the first place.

---

So What?
There are two issues here. One supply-side, one demand-side - how do either relate to farm profitability?

Supply-side

Who is selling the credits?
Should anyone be free to buy up land and sell credits, or should we specifically target agroforestry?
Trees can provide many other benefits, other than carbon capture, if used on farms
see here
Are those other benefits more important that just getting anyone to capture as much carbon as possible?
Link to farm profitability - if you want to maximise cross-benefits of on farm aforestation, you need to let farmers know how much money they could make...
£10,000 per ha (as in DEFRA radio advert, see farming today in PES doc) is more than enough to buy less credible international credits that offset your own emissions
Should the dissertation recommend that farmers recieve income even if they don't sell the credit? at the moment I think you only make money through the WCC if you sell your credits...
What about the woodland carbon guarantee? Do credits sold to the gov through that count against the farm's emissions, or are they allocated on by the government?
Demand-side

Who is buying the credits?
Ideally credits would be reserved for irreducable emissions
UK gov seems to be selling to anyone and relying on nascent CCS technologies to solve irreducable emissions later on
Which approach is right?
Link to farm profitability - It is unreasonable to expect farmers not to sell credits to anyone and everyone if they can make a good profit doing it - the climate crisis has come about because of short term profits anf a farm's own net-zero ambitions will come second to windfall profits... therefore, there is a need to restrict who can buy credits to only those who genuinely can't reduce their emissions.

Where UK regional agricultural production data is provided, it is generally done so in accordance with the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS), a hierarchical system used to divide the economic territories of the EU and the UK. @eurostatBackgroundNUTS2021 defines the three NUTS levels as follows:

-   NUTS 1: major socio-economic regions.
-   NUTS 2: basic regions for the application of regional policies.
-   NUTS 3: small regions for specific diagnoses.

NUTS Level 3 areas contain a minimum of 100 holdings and 10,000 ha [@defraTotalIncomeFarming2022]. Shapefiles for each NUTS level are provided by the Office for National Statistics [@onsNUTSLevelJanuary2019; @onsNUTSLevelJanuary2019b;

## Total Income From Farming {#TIFF-Methods}

Multiple sources were needed to gather data for Total Income from Farming (TIFF) and region size for the whole of the UK. TIFF and area data for England is provided at a resolution corresponding to NUTS level 3 regions by DEFRA [-@defraTotalIncomeFarming2022]. NUTS Level 2 TIFF and area data is provided for Scotland by the Scottish Government in their [-@scottishgovernmentTotalIncomeFarming2019] 'Total Income from Farming Estimates' publication, but not in their [-@scottishgovernmentTotalIncomeFarming2021] publication, where only NUTS Level 1 data is provided. For this reason, data for Scotland has been extracted from the older, but higher resolution, 2019 document. Neither the Welsh nor Northern Ireland Governments seem to publish estimates of TIFF, but the Scottish Government includes NUTS Level 1 estimates in their latest estimate [@scottishgovernmentTotalIncomeFarming2021], however, area estimates are not also provided. Area data for was instead taken for Northern Ireland from DAERA [-@daeraAgriculturalCensusNorthern2021] and for Wales from the Welsh Government [-@welshgovernmentAgricultureWales2019].

To enable the data to be plotted on the same map, all regional production data was converted to conform to the NUTS level 2 boundaries, as this was the highest resolution of data available for Scotland. Northern Ireland is treated as one region at NUTS level 2, however, Wales is divided into East and West. Due to time constraints, Wales has been treated as though it were one region under NUTS level 2, meaning identical TIFF values and equal area estimates have been used; this means that data for Wales should be interpreted as though it were a single region, not as it is represented in the figures as two regions.

```{r NUTS-Lookup-Table}
NUTS_Lookup <- read_csv(here("data_analysis/TIFF/NUTS_Lookup.csv"))

  footnote(general = "A section of the full lookup table which can be found in (DEFRA, 2022) or in this document's GitHub repository.", threeparttable = TRUE)
```

Conversion between boundaries was achieved using a lookup table, a small
section of which is shown in Table \@ref(tab:NUTS-Lookup-Table), and the
equations \@ref(eq:Regional-TIFF-Eq) and \@ref(eq:Regional-Area-Eq),

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\ \overline{\alpha} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i
(\#eq:Regional-TIFF-Eq)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\ \beta = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \beta_i
(\#eq:Regional-Area-Eq)
\end{equation}
```
where $\overline{\alpha}$ is equal to the target NUTS level 2 region's Total Income from Farming (TIFF), $\alpha_i$ equals the TIFF values of the corresponding NUTS Level 3 subregions, $\beta$ equals the total area of the NUTS level 2 region and $\beta_i$ equals the areas of the corresponding NUTS Level 3 subregions. An example calculation for the NUTS Level 3 region 'Tees Valley and Durham' is shown in Table \@ref(tab:Tees-Valley-Table).

\color{red}This is definitely overkill, I could just say the mean of X and the sum of Y...

But it could be cool to can the table and insert some more equations in to the results section showing an example calculation populated with names etc...\color{black}

## The Woodland Carbon Code {#WCC-Methods}

For the full details of the Woodland Carbon Code (WCC), see the 'Standard and Guidance' page of the WCC website [-@wccStandardGuidance2021]. What follows is a brief summary of the information contained there.

The Woodland Carbon Code (WCC) is a Government backed quality assurance standard for woodland creation projects in the UK. It was developed to support independent verification of carbon units, sometimes called carbon credits by other systems. Under the Woodland Carbon Code, carbon units come in two forms: Pending Issuance Units (PIUs) and Woodland Carbon Units (WCUs). A PIU represents an expectation that 1 tonne of $CO_2$ equivalent ($tCO_{2}e$) will be sequestered by a given project at some time in the future. \color{red}(I need to explain $CO_2$ vs $CO_{2}e$\color{black}. A WCU represents a guarantee that 1 $tCO_{2}e$ has already been sequestered by a given project. Only WCUs, not PIUs, can be used to offset emissions, however, PIUs can be sold *ex-ante* as an unguaranteed promise of a project's offset potential. Since a WCU represents a tangible current offset, and a PIU represents a promise to deliver a future offset, WCUs are generally worth more than PIUs. The sale value of PIUs and WCUs is not currently regulated or systematically recorded and is agreed between the seller and buyer for each transaction. To certify a project through the WCC, all proposed projects must initially be *validated* by an accredited independent body, typically within 3 years of the first tree being planted (the project start date). During *validation*, the total number of PIUs that are expected to be generated by the project is calculated and issued to the project owner, after which they are listed on the UK Land Carbon Registry, where they can be viewed and purchased. Each PIU belongs to a 'vintage', or time period during which it is expected to mature, meaning that the unit will transition from representing potential to actual sequestration (i.e., from a PIU to a WCU). To make this transition the unit must be *verified*, again by an accredited independent body, at which time the PIU is cancelled and the WCU issued. All projects last a maximum of 100 years; less if the intention is to harvest the timber, and the first vintage period ends 5 years after the project start date. For a 100 year project, each subsequent vintage lasts 10 years, until the final vintage, which lasts 5 years again. It is important to note that not all PIU are allocated to the project owner for sale. Version 2.0 of the Woodland Carbon Code stipulates that 20% of a project's units must be allocated to a communal 'buffer' account, owned by Scottish Forestry, to guarantee against unanticipated losses of stored carbon (for example, through forest fires). To demonstrate the concept of vintage periods and buffer accounts, an example project, taken from [@wccStandardGuidance2021], is provided in Table \@ref(tab:WCC-Example-Table).

```{r WCC-Example-Table}

Example_WCC_Project <- read_csv(here("data_analysis/WCC/Example_Project.csv"))

Example_WCC_tab <- kable(Example_WCC_Project,
      format = 'latex',
      digits = 0,
      format.args = list(big.mark = ","),
      caption = "Vitage periods and unit allocation of a hypothetical project estimated to sequester 50,000 tCO2e under the the Woodland Carbon Code.",
      booktabs = TRUE,
      linesep = "")

Example_WCC_tab %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"), font_size = 8, full_width = F) %>%
  column_spec(2:6 , width = "1.2cm") %>%
  column_spec(1 , width = "2cm") %>%
  row_spec(11, hline_after = TRUE)

```

Since all PIUs and WCUs are publicly listed in the UK Land Carbon Registry (managed by IHS Markit [-@ihsmarkitUKLandCarbon2022]), it is possible to see exactly how many PIU/WCUs have been issued, who they have been issued to, how much land is associated with each project, and more.

For the purposes of this dissertation, it was decided to focus on WCC certified projects owned by the Scottish Forest Alliance, a partnership formed in the late 1990s between BP Exploration Operating Company Limited, Forestry Commission Scotland, RSPB Scotland and Woodland Trust Scotland [@scottishforestallianceCreatingWoodlandsWildlife2010], since, although they are only the largest single owner of units under the Woodland Carbon Code - 1,552,085 issued units to Forest Carbon Ltd's 2,299,460 - all of their units are split between 16 projects and recorded in a single spreadsheet, compared to 161 projects and individual spreadsheets owned by Forest Carbon Ltd.

The Scottish Forest Alliance owns 16 projects certified under the Woodland Carbon Code, totalling 4,802 hectares, for which the partnership has been issued 1,210,513 PIUs (this excludes the 341,572 units issued to the buffer account), representing an expectation that collectively the projects will sequester 1,552,085 $tCO_{2}e$. To calculate the average sequestration rate per hectare (and therefore the average number of PIUs issued per hectare), the total number of PIUs was divided by total project area. The resulting value was corroborated using the expected range of 130 -- 450 $tCO_{2}e$/ha/100 years provided by the Forestry Comission [-@hawAssessingInvestmentReturns2017].

## Sources of Funding {#SoF-Methods}

Each of the four constituant countries of the UK provide their own woodland creation grant scheme. Due to time limitations, only the Scottish Forestry Grant Scheme was included in the profitability calculations, and all regions of the UK were assumed to recieve the same grant. This will introduce an unknown error to the regions of England, Wales and Norther Ireland.

The Scottish Forestry Grant Scheme data is displayed in Table \@ref(tab:Scottish-Grant-Table).

## The Price of Carbon {#PoC-Methods}

With some land owners reported to have said that they wouldn't sell below £100/unit. £100/unit at an average sequestration rate of 7tCO2/ha/yr puts those pieces of land among the most profitable in the UK (based on TIFF).

On the 3rd of May, 2022, emails were sent requesting information on the current sale price of PIUs and WCUs to Forest Carbon Ltd, Forest Direct Ltd, Scottish Woodlands Ltd, Fountains Forestry UK Ltd, the Ripa Gar Foundation, Tilhill, Cadzow Brothers, James Jones & Sons Ltd, TreeStory Ltd, RTS Forestry, the Woodland Trust, Bowlts Chartered Surveyors, Highfield Forestry Ltd, Crosscut Forestry Ltd, and a man named Michael Stuart, all of which are listed as Account Holders under the UK Land Carbon Registry [@ihsmarkitUKLandCarbon2022]. The Scottish Forest Alliance, the single largest owner of units under the WCC, seems to have shut down its website and no contact information could be found; the WCC project details list a Forest Reseach email address which was contacted instead.

What price per tonne of sequestration did I use in my calculations?

Where did the price come from?

Knowing the exact sale price of either a PCU or WCU under the Woodland Carbon Code at any given time is difficult since, unlike the units themselves, sales do not have to be publicly listed. Correspondence with Scottish Forestry,\color{red} the organisation responsible for the WCC\color{black}, suggests that, as of April 2022, WCUs are generally selling between £20-£50 per unit, up to an all-time maximum of £65/unit, and PIUs are generally selling between £10-£20 per unit, with an all-time maximum of £35/unit.

Nature Based Solutions are rivalled by artificial Carbon Capture and Storage technologies, but the price of one method will likely inform the eventual price of the other once both methods are established and stable.

Explain Carbon Capture and Removal - also look at the abbreviations, I think there is more than 1 type... DACCS and BECCS!

In 2019, Stripe, one of the largest providers of secure online payment processing, made a commitment to spend \$1M per year purchasing "negative $CO_2$ emissions at any price per t$CO_2$", in an attempt to kickstart the Carbon Capture and Removal industry [@stripeDecrementCarbonStripe2019]. In 2020, Stripe announced that it had invested in 4 carbon removal projects, the details of which are displayed in Table \@ref(tab:Stripe-Investments-Table) [@stripeStripeFirstCarbon2020].

Mention that Stripe includes 2 categories in "carbon removal technologies" : Carbon storage in the biosphere and Carbon storage outside of the biosphere (<https://stripe.com/blog/first-negative-emissions-purchases#climeworks-pricing-footnote-detail>).

```

What is the name of Stripe Climate fund? Was this the redecesor to the frontier fund? Talk about the new initiative in 2022 (Stripe's Frontier Fund).

While the price per tonne of $CO_2$ paid to these projects is far higher than the current price offered by carbon storage in the biosphere, such as through the Woodland Carbon Code (see \@ref(WCC-Methods), Stripe has stated that it is paying these prices with the explicit intention of being an early adopter in what it expects to become "a trillion dollar industry by the end of the century" once the price per tonne of $CO_2$ captured approaches 100 \$/t. The latest round of announced investments from autumn 2021 have modified their purchase agreements to include an estimate of the year during which the project will be capable of capturing one tonned of carbon for \$100 [@stripeEbbCarbonRemoval2021; @stripeEionCarbonRemoval2021; @stripeSustaeraCarbonRemoval2021]; previous agreements seem to have been bound by a funding criterium stating that the project would meet this target by 2040 [@stripeStripeFirstCarbon2020].

A value of around 100 \$/$tCO_2$ also features in other sources. Based on a review of 4 other papers, Broehm et al. [-@broehmTechnoEconomicReviewDirect2015] estimate that a reasonable long term range for the cost of DAC is 40-140 \$/$tCO_2$,

the IPCC WG III Sixth Assessment Report [-@ipccClimateChange20222022] states that anything under USD 100 /tCO2e is economical

The CCC Sixth Carbon Budget expects that carbon removal through new broadleaf woodland will cost £105/tCO2e by 2035. Page 41: <https://www.theccc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Sector-summary-Agriculture-land-use-land-use-change-forestry.pdf>

## Profitability of Afforestation {#Profitability-Afforestation-Methods}

Calculating the exact price received per tonne of $CO_2$ sequestered at which it becomes more profitable to plant trees than to continue with the current agricultural production system (referred to here as the transition price) for any given farm is not possible without primary data for two reasons: the amount of carbon sequestered per unit area is highly variable, as shown if Table \@ref(tab:Presentable-WCC-BP-data), and the current profitability specific to that farm is not known, giving nothing to compare the profitability of afforestation to. However, by using a range of values for these two inputs, an output range within
which the transition price for any given farm is likely to occur can be calculated.

For each of the 16 Scottish Forest Alliance projects, a figure for expected total sequestration and total area was calculated then aggregated to produce a collective average. These figures could then be used to calculate the average rate of sequestration per project, and for all projects, using Equation \@ref(eq:Average-Sequestration),

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\ \delta = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \epsilon_i / \sum_{i=1}^{n} \kappa_i
(\#eq:Average-Sequestration)
\end{equation}
```
where $\delta$ is equal to the rate of sequestration ($tCO_2e/ha$), $\epsilon$ is equal to expected total sequestration ($tCO_2e$), and $\kappa$ is equal to area (ha), with results recorded in Table \@ref(tab:Presentable-WCC-BP-data). The average rate of sequestration, $\delta$, was then used to calculate the transition price by utilising a regional average Total Income From Farming (TIFF) for each NUTS 2 region, displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:TIFF-Map-Figure), using Equation \@ref(eq:neccesary-carbon-price),

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\ \theta = ( \iota \times 100 ) / \delta
(\#eq:neccesary-carbon-price)
\end{equation}
```
where $\theta$ equals the transition price ($£/tCO_2e$), $\iota$ equals TIFF (£/ha), and $\delta$ equals the average rate of sequestration per hectare ($tCO_2e/ha$), with results recorded in Table \@ref(tab:Carbon-Price-UK-tab). Note that TIFF ($\iota$) must be multiplied by 100 to establish the expected income from farming for the next 100 years, meaning it can be directly compared to the 100-year WCC projects.

\color{red}At this time, TIFF has been assumed to be fixed over this period, though that may change if I have time to do some calculations... Note also that this is comparing total income from farming to gross margin for afforestation.\color{black}

When including planting density info in the calcs:

"The CCC's Sixth Carbon Budget (2020) states that in order to approach agricultural "net zero" by 2050, rates of afforestation must reach 30,000 ha/year by 2025 (a target the government has already committed to (DEFRA, 2020)), compared to just 1,420 hectares of afforestation in 2019 (Harvey, 2019)."

Probably best to have a paragraph explaining that tax has been left out for simplicity, but explain favoured tax status of woodland etc to show it has been considered.

- If income received for carbon credits is pre tax can I ignore tax?
- The farm management handbook has info on farm income tax rates. p548.
- Commercial woodland enjoys a "tax favoured status", but only if commercial timber production is the primary purpose of the land, meaning this (probably?) doesn't apply to farms. p545.
- Stamp duty land tax??? p544.
- VAT?? p540.

The plot below uses the following reference. I'm including it here so that I can copy the text into the 'source' caption of the plot (@ihsmarkitRegistryProjectDetails2022).

```{r BP-PIU-plot, fig.cap = "example caption"}
BP_PIU_TOTAL_plot
```

```{r All-WCC-PIU-Plot, fig.cap = "All currently issued PIUs under the Woodland Carbon Code and when they become available for use as offsets."}
WCC_and_BP_plot
```

Why include this? Because under the WCC a pending issuance unit cannot be used to offset emissions, it can be sold as a promise to offset in
the future, but only verified credits can be used, and this (original!) graph shows that at the moment we haven't reached the point at which all the carbon credits are being sold, but this is a log scale, credits are going to start becoming widely available very soon, over double availability by 2025 (compared to 2022) and ocer 5 times by 2030. We still have time to restrict the sale of credits (make farmers keep enough to offset their own emissions and sell what is left to people that can prove they cannot reduce emissions any other way)... This is also only representitive of CURRENTLY ISSUED CREDITS, there are more and more trees being planted every year and more and more applications being made to the WCC and other funding schemes (welsh gov funding see Costing the World podcast on Carbon Farming).

The point I'm making is that the new IPCC WG3 report say that sequestration "cannot compensate for delayed emission reductions in other sectors" but that the Woodland Carbon Code say "We believe all companies should have the opportunity to compensate for their emissions" on their website. These two statements seem to be at odds with eachother...

Should I insert this data in the appendix? NO, it is 5,500 rows long. Maybe upload it with the code to the github page.

Also could be cool to add another line to this showing EXPECTED (not actual) WCC Units by 2100. Afforestation isn't going to slow down...

The original data for this plot is taken from [@ihsmarkitUKLandCarbon2022]. The modified data set can be found at the document's the GitHub page. For more information on IHS Markit and the UK Land Carbon Registry, see [@wccWhatUKLand2021].

When looking at tree data, some species include a suffix, such as Ash (MB). Based on the two sources below, I think this refers to the following

MB = Mixed Broadleaf XB = Other Broadleaf XF= Other Fir etc.

<https://www.forestryengland.uk/sites/default/files/pdf/Timber%20Sales%20Abbreviations.pdf>
<https://www.woodlandcarboncode.org.uk/images/PDFs/WCC_CarbonAssessmentProtocol_V2.0_March2018.pdf>

Need to make note of the difference between total project area and area under trees (presumably there is some open space in each of the projects) as total area under trees is less than total area, as seen in plot of species in each project.

# Discussion {#SectionDiscussion}

INCLUDE THE LIT REVIEW Assessment

This report highlighs some of the successes of the clean development mechanism that is criticised by some of the lit review paper

https://www.wired.co.uk/article/trees-carbon-capture-genes

---

Things to discuss: - House et al. point to the Sherwood plot which indicates that as a material becomes more dilute in its surroundings it becomes more expensive to extract (House et al., 2011, p. 3; Ranjan & Herzog, 2011, p. 2871) - Source: <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2665702> - DAC becomes more expensive as atmospheric $CO_2$ concentrations fall - is the same true for trees? Probably not? But they do grow slower (see increased crop growth from climate change...)

-   If you look at regions of LFA, most of wales would probably be much lower income than it is in the map of TIFF - but because the country is treated as a whole it looks like income is comparatively high (parts should be purple probably)

---

WHAT IS MY COUNTER-FACTUAL?
State that I am assuming that the current uses of land will remain fixed.
I'm saying that planting trees will have a negative impact on land use change, but what if diets to change to reduce meat consumption and land is freed up to plant trees on... then there would be no impact on land use change...
Some regions are highly profitable based on livestock production, so I might say "it is less profitable to plant trees at carbon price X in region Y", but what if a carbon tax is brought in that makes livestock farming much more expensive?

One of the Farming today episode talks about how it will become super unprofitable to grow food on peat due to the carbon emisssions.

Why would investment firms be rushing to buy land now? As can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:PIU-per-HA), rates of sequestration are not stable over the 100 life of the projects, peaking around the 25 - 30 year mark. Though the average rate of sequestration for the Scottish Forest Alliance projects ranges to around 5 tCO2e/ha over the 100-year life of the project, the peak rate can be as high as 13.4 tCO2e/ha/year [@ihsmarkitRegistryProjectDetails2022]; Natural England report that mixed native broadleaved woodland in England can reach sequestration rates of up to 25.5 tCO2e/ha/year below year 30, with an average of 14.5 tCO2e/ha/year [@naturalenglandCarbonStorageSequestration2021]. Under the Woodland Carbon Code, PIUs cannot be used to offset emissions, as explained in Section \@ref(WCC-Methods). Only once a PIU is destroyed and a WCU is issued in its place can that unit be used as an emissions offset, meaning that there is a strong incentive to maximise the number of units that mature before 2050 since this is the nominal target for Net Zero ambitions to be achieved. Given that we are 28 years away from 2050, it makes sense to plant now to ensure that projects have enough time to reach peak sequestration rates.

Should this section go in the intro or the discussion>?  currently in both...

So what?

My research points to two key policy changes:

Supply side

- Who is selling the credits?
  + Oil and Gas / investment firms, or farmers?
  + Does it matter?

- If you want to maximise cross-benefits of afforestation (erosion protection, biodiversity, etc), you need to convince farmers to start planting trees, which is best done by telling them how much money they could make.

Demand side

- Who is buying the credits?
  + Ideally credits would be reserved for irreducible emissions

- It is unreasonable to expect farmers not to sell credits to anyone and everyone if they are A) allowed to, and B) can make a good profit doing so. There is a need for policies that restrict who can buy credits to only those who genuinely can't reduce their emissions.

I found this quote interesting: “Water utilities, for example, are natural monopolies tasked with managing a public good. As with most infrastructure, what is being paid for is not the commodity (water) but the social outcome (water security).”

Boccaletti, Giulio. ‘The New Land Economy’. Project Syndicate. 11 February 2022. https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/climate-change-requires-new-land-economy-by-giulio-boccaletti-2022-02.

Carbon sequestration seems (to me) to be the same, we’re paying for a social outcome (mitigated climate change) not the commodity (carbon), so do you think this could be a useful way to think about carbon – should there be a publicly funded national/regional authority that manages carbon stocks and flows, rather than trying to incentivise individual action (planting trees etc), or is there a fundamental difference between carbon and water that I’m not seeing? I suppose that’s sort of what the forestry commission does actually, plants trees at a national scale, and trees on farms are just a bit extra on the side…

"the unlucky humans alive today who must fix a problem they did not entirely cause to help save people they will never meet from disasters they can scarcely imagine"
- https://www.ft.com/content/53c2b185-6cb9-4097-9ff7-efb53041430c?desktop=true&segmentId=7c8f09b9-9b61-4fbb-9430-9208a9e233c8#myft:notification:daily-email:content

One of the highest forms of charity as laid out by Maimonides (a 900 year old Jewish philosopher) is to give charity to an unknown recipient, and for the recipient to not know the identity of the giver. [@maimonidesLawsCharity1180]

As laid out 900 years ago, the greatest act of giving... we have an intergenrational responsibility to mitigate the worst affects of climate change... planting trees could be one way in which we do this and carbon markets can help do this if implemented correctly, but only if we do it right... etc. etc.

Doing good in the world requires first that we do no harm. Not putting everything we can in to the 1.5C target is a failure of this responsibility.

---

There is a criticism of afforestation because we need to increase food production for food security,
- Article arguing agianst that point:
- https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/16/food-crisis-britain-prices-russia-ukraine-rewilding

This could also be a good introduction/conclusion point: the immediate challenges posed by food security and ukraine war do not mean that we should abandon trying to prevent the long term challenge of biodiversity/climate crises, if we ignore them now they will lead to considerable immediate challenges later.

"We conclude that farmers should be wary of selling carbon offset credits to buyers upfront as this could harm their own decarbonisation efforts. It is likely to be more beneficial for them to work together with food businesses to reduce emissions and sequester carbon within the supply chain."

Talk about the need to bring in scope 1 2 and 3 emissions, and the fact that state state-centric emissions allocation is flawed in a global supply chain (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4075123&dgcid=ejournal_htmlemail_climate:action:ejournal_abstractlink) Deiter helm also agrees with this I think - The CCC suggests that reducing teratorial emissions to net zero will mean we are no longer responsible for climate change - Dieter Helm find this annoying because imported products still have emissions. somewhere in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1895&v=x3f5oM2DbAQ&feature=youtu.be

Should I mention jevons paradox? Companies making spurious net zero claims may lead to increased consumption of their product because it is percieved as better - for example - LEON claim to sell net zero beef burgers (I think? Maybe remembering wrong), if that claim is misleading, it could lead people to choose beef over plant burgers, thereby increasing emissions that could otherwise have occured...

Found a source: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/20/leon-carbon-neutral-burgers-restaurant-environmental?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other

The environmental credentials of Leon’s “carbon-neutral” burgers have been questioned after it emerged the fast-food chain was using controversial carbon offsets to make the claim.

What does the IPCC classify as a hard to reduce emission? It is hard to reduce emissions from air travel, but you can easily just reduce the number of flights (holidays etc), so is it hard to reduce, or not?

there is also the new tree health ELM scheme https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tree-health-pilot-scheme
